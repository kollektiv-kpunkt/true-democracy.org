> [true-democracy.org](https://true-democracy.org) *(«TD»)* will be **the truest form of open-source platform to collect signatures and supporters for open-letters, petitions and calls to action.** The platform will be self-hostable and offered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution hosted TD's servers for free and forever. The entire cost of maintenance shall be crowd-sourced and paid for by organizations that can afford it, meaning organizations with a bigger capacity to pay for the service. The data of the supporters will only ever be in the hands of the people who launched the action and will under no circumstances be touched by TD or any other third party.


# Introduction
A lot of people who are into political activism know, that there will come a time, where you will want to launch a petition to demand a group or an individual to perform a certain task: Small thing, like when you want your local representative to take action on a very narrow issue. Big things, like when you want your national government to finally get a move on when it comes to climate change. And when you're at this point, most activists turn to one of the established platforms to do exactly this. As a political individual from the German speaking part of Switzerland, I can list several solutions off the top of my head. But all of these platforms have one central flaw: **They all take advantage of the people who just want to change the world for the better in some way or another.**

It is understandable, that the organizations behind these platforms have their own interests they need to serve. At the end of the day, they are going to have to for instance pay the bills for whatever expenses they may have. When you're offering your services to the people who wanna take action for free, you're going to have to find a way to raise the capital to finance your and your activists' missions. And while I cannot imagine that most of these actors do these things in bad faith, I personally stand behind the idea that they are taking advantage of people.

This is why I propose to you a different approach, formulated in the following mission:

**true-democracy.org is going to be a platform for every person to launch a petition, open-letter or any similar form of democratic action in accordance with an open and sustainable worldview free of charge and with total control over the contacts who signed their own petition.**

Let me briefly lay out how I want to make sure this mission can be followed.

# Details

## Financing
The crux to be solved is the financing of the platform. Because there are two different types of cost, specifically the initial development cost and the maintenance and security cost, these two types shall be financed in two separate ways.

The former, the initial costs, will in a first step be provided by [Kreativ Kollektiv K. KlG](https://kpunkt.ch), the company I am currently employed by, and later on be collected from organizations and individuals who are willing to donate to the project. It is important to us that every person who is going to contribute to the realization of this project is compensated fairly: Political activism on this level, the hard work that is not necessarily appealing to anyone and that doesn't benefit you or your reputation but is crucial to the process of supporting people in being heard, cannot be expected to be done voluntarily.

The latter, the maintenance, security and functional expansion costs, will be collected on the one hand from patrons who are willing to commit recurring sums of money and organizations who want the platform to include novel and expansive features. The license of TD will have to be formulated in a way that every addition to the code base, the project infrastructure or any other expansion must be publicly and freely (where free doesn't mean "without payment" but actually free without any strings attached at all, e.g. allowing people to use the software but giving up access to the contacts who sign the action to a third party) available for every activist without any exception.

While this undertaking might seem ambitious, I truly believe that this understanding of how the project will be financed and run is essential to its success. It is the world I personally want to live in and am hoping that others want to come along for the ride.

## Functionality
The basic functionality of a platform to host your petition is pretty straight forward. I personally have and will continue to set up these kinds of projects with two goals in mind: Actual, real-world change and rallying people around an issue, connecting them to each other and giving organizations the tools to find people who are in support of their causes.

I therefor want to propose the following platform-functions as essential:

- [ ] Being able to sign an action
- [ ] Giving people a clear understanding what they're signing through a simple, readable and accessible action-design
	- [ ] Easy to use Interface, which allows organizations to spin-up an action within minutes
- [ ] Giving organizations easy access to the contacts that have signed
	- [ ] Syncing contacts to other tools, external databases and marketing machinery

These functions are, at this point, formulated in a very broad way on purpose: While it is clear to me, that specific functions (like being able to share the action on different social media platforms or syncing a personalized domain-name to the petition) are crucial to the success of a petition, the project is in such an early phase that it is impossible for me to specifically point out which ideas can be implemented without knowing to a reasonable extent how many and which organizations are interested in the idea of supporting TD.
